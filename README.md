# Users' Goals
Users may be trying to identify patterns or correlations between various variables such as sleep duration, quality of sleep, physical activity, stress levels, and health indicators (The BMI category of the person Underweight, Normal, Overweight) They might also be interested in understanding how these factors differ based on gender, age, and occupation.

# Choice of Visualization
I chose the visualization, Kernel Density estimate plot, which is effective for understanding the distribution of the "Age" variable across different "Occupation" categories, separated by "Gender." This type of plot allows users to observe the concentration of age values within each subgroup, helping identify potential trends or differences.


# Additional Features
The use of color in the kde plot further enhances the visualization by differentiating between occupations. This makes it easier for users to compare age distributions among different professions within each gender category.

Overall, the application is geared towards providing insights into the relationships between sleep disorders, health, lifestyle, and demographic factors. The chosen visualizations and features aim to make this exploration efficient and insightful for the specified user group.
